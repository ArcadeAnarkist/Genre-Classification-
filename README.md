# Genre-Classification-
DTU januar projekt - ITIS m/ Gruppe 7 

This projekt explores which supervised machine learning models are best at classifying songs intro genres based on their spotify API features. 

## Tech Stack 
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- imblearn
- collections 
- Matplotlib

## Dataset 
This datasdet was found through kaggle. The entire dataset can be found in the file dataset.csv, whilst the file "januar.py" is the code used to sort our subgenres into the main genres. The link too kaggle can be found in our report. 

## 
Each model (Random Forest, SVM, Neural Network), has all code regarding each model (training, plots, oversampling etc.) in each their Python Notebooks.
